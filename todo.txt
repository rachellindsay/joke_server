Todo list!:

Part 1) 
See if you can configure nginx so that it serves your static html directly, and only forwards /app paths to node.   
  - You will move app/public/index.html and styles.css to nginx/public. 
  - Joke.js will get restructured (step 3) 
  - You should be able to run just the nginx container, and http://localhost:8080 should display your joke page html. The button will no longer work.

    Joke server directory
      - public  
          - index.html  
          - styles.css
      - Dockerfile
      - default.conf
      - compose.yaml

Part 2) 
See if you can get the node server so that it responds to the http://localhost:8080/app/joke url with json containing a random joke.

    Joke server directory
      - app dir
          - (jokes.js) ???
          - index.js --- include express
          - Dockerfile
          - dockerignore
      - nginx dir
          - public
            - index.html
            - styles.css
          - Dockerfile
          - default.conf
      - compose.yaml


Part 3) 
Wire up the button in the joke server so that it makes an ajax call to /app/joke, gets the json with the random joke, and displays it. Use axios to make the ajax call.

    Joke server directory
      - app dir
          - (jokes.js) ???
          - index.js --- include express
          - Dockerfile
          - dockerignore
      - nginx dir
          - public
            - index.html
            - styles.css
          - Dockerfile
          - default.conf
      - compose.yaml


4) 
Use .gitignore so that you don't have app/node_modules under git
